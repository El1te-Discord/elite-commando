EliteCommando

Thank you for choosing EliteCommando to power your bot!

To get started, head over to config.json and change "TOKEN_HERE" to your bot token. You can find this here: https://discord.com/developers/applications/CLIENT_ID_HERE/bot

Then, in your terminal, type "npm i".

After that go to commands/template.js and read through it all. Then you can use that to make any commands you like!

Once you make all your commands, save them and type "node index.js" in the terminal!
